 <h2>HOW TO RUN</h2>
 >So, to boil down you will need to add a new .env file to your local file-system
 ><br>The .env file should have :
 >>DB_HOST= "localhost"<br>
   DB_USER= " the name of the user having admin privalege to database "<br>
   DB_PASS= " password of your mysql database "<br>
   DB_DATABASE= "name of the database you want to give"<br>
   DB_DIALECT= "mysql"<br>
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID =    .....<br>
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET =  ....<br>
   PASS= "the password you will set"<br>
   
 So discussing last 3 from above:<br>
 
 1. GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID And GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET:<br>
    These should be generated by you, by registering<br>
    the app on google developers site. These cannot be<br>
    shared, because of security reasons.
 2. PASS:<br>
    As you can see in server.js, we are using an email-id to <br>
    send mails to the clients. So, as same reason above, we<br>
    are hiding its new password. You can create your own<br>
    new gmail account as per your need.
    
    
>Also one important thing: delete the node_modules package if downloaded
>Always do a fresh install of node_modules, whenever downloaded from github
>These are affected by different OS environment.
>As package.json is already in project, so all you need to run is:
> "npm install"
